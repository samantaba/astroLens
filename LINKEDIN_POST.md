🔭 **Excited to announce AstroLens - An AI-Powered Astronomical Anomaly Discovery System!**

After months of development, I'm thrilled to open-source AstroLens, a tool that brings the power of modern AI to astronomical discovery.

**What makes it special?**

🌌 **Autonomous Discovery** - Runs 24/7 in the background, scanning astronomical images from SDSS, Galaxy Zoo, and more while you sleep

🧠 **Self-Improving AI** - Uses Vision Transformers that continuously fine-tune on discoveries, achieving 83.9% accuracy with +4.9% improvement over training

🔍 **Multi-Catalog Cross-Reference** - Automatically checks findings against SIMBAD, NED, and VizieR to identify if detections are known objects or potential new discoveries

📊 **Advanced OOD Detection** - Ensemble voting with 3 methods (MSP, Energy, Mahalanobis) for robust anomaly detection

**The vision?** 

Make astronomical discovery accessible to everyone. Whether you're a citizen scientist, astronomy enthusiast, or researcher, AstroLens helps you find what the universe is hiding.

**Technical highlights:**
• Vision Transformer-based classification
• Out-of-Distribution detection ensemble
• FAISS similarity search
• Real-time catalog cross-reference (SIMBAD, NED, VizieR)
• Beautiful PyQt5 desktop interface
• FastAPI backend with SQLite

The project has already discovered **373 anomaly candidates** and processed **2,600+ images** autonomously.

Would love to hear your thoughts and contributions! 🚀
